Some Example code to do SolidFire API calls using Ruby.  

This version is VERY simple, and does little to no error checking.  
The example at the bottom creates a user, creates a volume, deletes the volume, 
purges the volume and deletes the user.... watch quick because it's all gone 
at the end, or comment out the deletes to see it, but then again you will get a
duplicate user error the next time you run it.
